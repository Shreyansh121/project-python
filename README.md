Gemini Bot Using API and Streamlit
This repository contains a project to build a Gemini bot using external APIs and the Streamlit framework for creating interactive, real-time web applications. The bot interacts with users, providing information and responding to queries by leveraging various API endpoints.

Features:
API Integration: The bot is powered by APIs that enable it to fetch and process real-time data.

Streamlit Web Interface: An interactive web interface built with Streamlit that allows users to interact with the Gemini bot in real-time.

Natural Language Processing: The bot uses NLP techniques to process user queries and provide intelligent responses.

Customizable Responses: Modify and extend the botâ€™s functionality to include custom responses based on different API integrations.

Tech Stack:
Python: The core programming language used for building the bot.

Streamlit: A framework to create real-time, interactive web applications.

API: External APIs are integrated to fetch data and interact with the bot.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Used to interpret and respond to user queries.
